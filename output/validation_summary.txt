✅ VALIDATED:
   - Cross-validation is stable across methods (5-fold, 10-fold, repeated)
   - LOO-CV confirms performance (~0.935)
   - Bootstrap 95% CI: [0.867, 0.985]
   - Permutation test p-value: 0.01 (statistically significant)
   - No obvious preprocessing leakage
   - Model significantly outperforms random baseline

⚠️ CONCERNS:
   - Hypotension_Level=2 perfectly predicts ICU (potential circularity)
   - Train-Val gap: 0.057 (monitor for overfitting)
   - Small sample size (n=149) limits generalizability
   - Without hypotension, AUROC drops to ~0.86

📋 RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. Verify Hypotension_Level is measured BEFORE ICU decision
   2. Present sensitivity analysis (with/without hypotension)
   3. Acknowledge sample size limitations
   4. Frame appropriately: "risk stratification tool" not "prediction model"
   5. External validation essential before clinical use
